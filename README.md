# Hello this is, Magic 8 Cube!
By: Ryan Ni

# Introduction
Magic 8 Cube is a "Magic 8 Ball" inspired project, except better because it's a cube, the superior shape.

# What it does
Magic 8 Cube holds the power of premonition and foresight! But in exchange for its power, the Magic 8 Cube may only answer yes or no questions.

# How I built it
I programmed a Arduino NANO mounted on a terminal adapter to detect vibrations via a vibration sensor and print its output messages on an OLED Display. It draws power from a 9 Volt Alkaline Battery component.

# Challenges I ran into
One of the chelleges I faced was configuring my actuator on my vibration sensor to set as the threshold in order to activate the program.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
The project functions as a real magic 8 ball!

# What's next for Magic 8 Cube
Possibly adding more output messages.

# Overview
Here are some quick links to some of the resources I developed while creating this project:
